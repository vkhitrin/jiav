 jiav Manifest
***************

``jiav`` manifest is a YAML-based input used by the tool to achieve an
automatic verification workflow:

.. code::

   jiav:
     verified_status: "Done"
     verification_steps:
       <verification_steps>

Goals of a ``jiav`` manifest:

-  Human-readable and machine-readable.
-  Extendable.
-  Robust.
