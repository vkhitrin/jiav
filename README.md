# jiav

This repository is a **Proof of Concept.**

## Limitations And Words Of Caution

**This tool is only tested against self-hosted (data center version) Jira.**  
I have no access to a cloud Jira instance.

Since this tool executes commands locally, we should avoid trusting public comments as much as possible.  
It will default to scanning only private comments (regardless of the visibility group). It is possible to read from public comments **if you understand the potential risk, this might cause to your systems**.

The output of verification steps is also not uploaded as attachments by default because it is impossible to limit attachments' visibility, refer to [JRASERVER-3893](https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-3893). It is possible to attach the output **if you understand the potential risk, this might expose sensitive information**.

## General

![jiav flow](https://jiav.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/Flow.jpeg)

Jira Issues Auto Verification.  
This tool aims to provide an auto-verification framework for Jira issues.  
Users provide a YAML-formatted comment in Jira issues, and the tool will execute it.
On successful execution, the issue will move to the desired status.

Example of a manifest:

```yaml
---
jiav:
  verified_status: "Done" # Status has to be present in the project workflow
  verification_steps:
    - name: Check line exists in file
      backend: line
      path: /path/to/file
      line: hello_world
```

`jiav` allows developers to build custom backends; refer to the [documentation guide](docs/source/developing_backends.rst).  
An example of a backends shipped externally:

- [jiav-backend-ansible](https://github.com/vkhitrin/jiav-backend-ansible) **this is a risky backend since it allows users to run arbitrary code. Be cautious when enabling it.**
- [jiav-backend-command](https://github.com/vkhitrin/jiav-backend-command) **This is a risky backend since it allows users to run arbitrary code. Be cautious when enabling it.**

```

Attempt to verify issues from a JQL and output the result in JSON format:

```bash
jiav --debug verify --jira='<JIRA_URL>' --access-token='<ACCESS_TOKEN>' --query='issue = "KEY-1"' --format='json'
```

### List backends

```bash
jiav list-backends
```

### Validate manifest
